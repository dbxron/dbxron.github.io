### CPSC 120


* Lab 3


   Lab 3, part 2 is one of favorite assignments we’ve done because I got to work with multiple functions, and it’s one of the first assignments where I was able to work with Arithmetic operators. The overall idea of Julian days was interesting, especially because I hadn’t heard of the concept until this lab.
* Lab 5


   Lab 5, part 1 is one of my favorite assignments I did this semester because it was one of the first assignments in which we worked with  command line arguments. The concept of vectors and command line arguments was one of the topics I struggled with, yet this lab was very interesting and straightforward.
